# Sorting Algorithms Project
- Contains different sorting algorithms which are tested using arrays of random numbers
- Program analyzes the real time complexity of the sorting algorithm after sorting the given data and graphs the results
- Graph shows a comparison of theoretical time complexity and the real time complexity
